### A game where the player has to pick up some sprite and keep it alive for a set time from the evil sprites thats are trying to kill them. Essentially, this is a survival-focused variation of classic Asteroid, without the shooting and with an “companion cube”-esque element.

## How-to
### Run the file-- pygame_bnair.py --and that's it! The game should run properly.

## Included (and Used) Source Files:
### * Images = companion.bmp, enemy.bmp, hero.bmp, heroAndCompanion.bmp
